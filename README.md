# The Qbounce height-calculator 
QBounce is a tool that helps you calculate the height of a balls peak. 
We uses an novel and advanced training algorithm, called the fortuna algorithm, 
to train a model that can predict the height of a ball. It is trained on localy sourced data,
and is therefore very accurate.

## tutorial
This is the tutorial on how to use the Qbounce heigth calculator

start by navigating to /qbounce/calculator

### input a custum duration
if you want to enter a custum duration you can edit the input bar of the calculator.
Keep in mind it expects a duration from the peak of the ball trajectory, until it hits the ground.

once you edit the input it, you must now press submit time when ready.

### use the built in stopwatch
press top of path as the ball is at the top of its path.
then press hit the ground as it hits the ground.
The duration is now locked in.


### next
now that you have a locked in heigth you press calculate heigth, and it will automatically calculate the heigth of the ball at its peak, using advanced quantum algorithms!!

you are presented with a result. if you may now delete it and move on to the next recording
or you can press save, give it a name, and it will be saved in the history below. If you chose to save it is not to late, you can also delete elements from the history.

The elements in history are saved using the latest most advanced and secure database available; Your browsers localstorage.
